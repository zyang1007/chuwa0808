### springboot: redbook
Implement Spring security - in memory.

1. Comment out the defined role in `application.properities`;
2. add spring security properties into `config` and `controller` layers.


#### Note:
- user "chuwa" has role USER; user "admin" has role ADMIN;
- so admin can call the api, chuwa can not.
